# Cult.DAO Proposal - Celestrak.eth

1.  What is the name of your project?

    **Celestrak.eth**

2. Have you read the manifesto?
    
    **YES**

3. Have you read the suggested investment guidelines?
  
    **YES**
  
4. Which suggested investment guidelines do you think apply to your project?
  
    **Option 6: Decentralized grant or charitable donation
    A decentralized grant for a cause or technology with no expectation of profits that benefits the greater good through blockchain or the world at large.**

5. Can you give a brief outline of your project?
    
    **Create an open-source public, decentralized, censorship-free space data framework. Enable anyone, anywhere, anytime to publish and consume space data.**

6. What is your website?

    **[Celestrak.eth](https://ipfs.io/ipns/celestrak.eth).**

7. Do you have a whitepaper and if so, where can we find a copy?
  
    **KEYSPACE whitepaper in progress [here](https://github.com/DigitalArsenal/keyspace/wiki/Space-Data-Network-(KEYSPACE)-Whitepaper).**
  
8. Do you have a pitchdeck and if so where can we find a copy?

    **No.**

9. Do you have a link to your tokenomics?

    **No.**

10. Have your smart contracts been audited?  If so, please indicate where the audit can be found.

    **No.**

11. Can you list your relevant social channels?

    **[Dr. Kelso on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TSKelso)**

12. Why do you want to work with Cult Dao?

    **The whitepaper, the tokenomics, lack of public / apparent VC backing, donations without reciprocation, the dedicated community.**

13. How does your project meet our three core tenants: fight centralization, further the cause of Decentralization, and support a noble cause?

    **Current centralized space data sources are highly censored / filtered, with access controls.  No open-source, decentralized method to publicly publish / consume space data.  No open-source mechanism to verify data, data sources (PKI).**
    
14. Can you tell us a little bit about your team?

    **[Dr. T.S. Kelso](https://celestrak.com/webmaster.php)**

    **No.**

16. If your token is launched, can you indicate your contract number and blockchain?

    **N/A**

17. If your token isn’t launched, when will your TGE take place?

    **N/A**

18. What are the terms of the investment vesting if it applies?

    **N/A**

19. How do you plan on creating awareness for your project or your cause?

    **[The world is already well aware](https://www.google.com/search?q=celestrak&sxsrf=APq-WBvPhHW-kRhnRhfyAwZXjAs1jnwm3w:1650144822673&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiCve6_xJn3AhVVl3IEHWapApsQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1536&bih=757&dpr=2.5).**

20. How would funding from Cult benefit you or your cause?

    **Taking funding from governments, VCs, corporations would come with strings attached.**

21. Can you list the main contact from your project?

    **[TJKoury](mailto:tj@digitalarsenal.io)**

22. Would you be interested in doing a Twitter space or Discord AMA with Cult Dao?

    **Yes.**

23. What would you want to tell the “many” about your project in order to convince the community that we should help to fund your project or your cause?
     
     **Responsible use of outer-space does not rely on any single entity.  With the advent of commercial space companies, the space environment has become more contested every year.  Discussions between [responsible parties](https://metro.co.uk/2021/12/30/elon-musk-denies-his-starlink-satellites-are-hogging-space-15839814/) must be based on non-biased data, from a system with no artifical limitations on what can be published or by whom, and with the same data being made available to all parties.  The data should also be cryptographically signed, validated, and verified.  Unfortunately, no such system currently exists.**
     
      **Prior to the [Iridium / COSMOS collision in 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_satellite_collision), most space policy makers subscribed to the [Big Sky Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_sky_theory) of collision avoidance.  After the collision, I was tasked to create a data pipeline from the classified government systems to the public portal on the internet, Space-Track.org, which I rewrote with a  
[new API](https://web.archive.org/web/20130323001324/https://space-track.org/).**

      **Since then, the space environment has only gotten more congested, putting [critical space infrastructure in danger](https://www.gpsworld.com/space-debris-endangers-gps/), as well as [people on the ground](https://www.space.com/china-huge-rocket-falling-from-space-junk-problem).** 

      **The centralized military, civil, and commercial systems available for sharing space data are all very closely monitored / controlled, using Web 1 & 2.0 technologies.  All have significant barriers to entry, and none have an open-source, universal public key infrastructure (PKI).**

      **These limitations lead to private companies creating [closed solutions](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/10/slingshot-aerospace-raises-25m-to-help-satellite-operators-navigate-space-traffic/) that stakeholders must trust a priori.**

      **Since 1985, [Celestrak](https://celestrak.com) has been an open data portal for [space catalog data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set). It is the most trafficked public space data site, with millions of unique visitors a week.  It is the data backbone for [most open-source space data libraries / projects](https://github.com/search?q=celestrak), and most closed ones as well.  The webmaster, [Dr. Kelso](https://celestrak.com/webmaster.php) has agreed to explore Web 3.0 options for publishing the data on Celestrak, which include [corrections to the official space catalog](https://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/supplemental/), usually created using owner/operator data.**

      **I am proposing a decentralized space data sharing network using Bitcoin / Ethereum keys for identity, data signing, and encryption.  Public blockchains will be used to establish a web-of-trust by sending transactions between addresses with trust metadata attached, and IPFS will be used to [publish data associated with those keys](https://ipfs.io/ipns/celestrak.eth/).  Other tech like NFTs can be used to track data / assets as well.**

      **This decentralized network will be interoperable with current centralized solutions, and data can be published / consumed without arbitrary limits.**

      **Current state of the work:**

      **- Funded effort through the Department of Commerce on [SpaceDataStandards.org](https://spacedatastandards.org/) to create modern data standards for space data, and serialization code auto-generated by using the [Google Flatbuffer Compiler](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/).**
      
      **- Set of code repositories under my company, [DigitalArsenal.io, Inc.](https://github.com/orgs/DigitalArsenal/repositories?q=key&type=all&language=&sort=), with libraries under development to support the [above mentioned concepts](https://github.com/DigitalArsenal/keyspace/wiki/Space-Data-Network-(KEYSPACE)-Whitepaper)**
      
      **- Upgrading Celestrak to convert the old punch-card data formats to [modern serialization standards](https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/gp-data-formats.php)**
      
      **- A testbed IPNS-addressed IPFS decentralized data store at [Celestrak.eth](https://ipfs.io/ipns/celestrak.eth/)**

      **There is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done to create, deploy, and maintain the tools required for this project to become a reality.  Contributions, whether monetary or time/effort, are greatly appreciated.**
